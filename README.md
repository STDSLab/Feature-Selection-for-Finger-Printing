# Feature-Selection-for-Finger-Printing

These functions implement our feature selection methods for FC fingerprinting.

Use Learn functions (LearnRS, LearnACSC) to score node or edge features. Once features are scored, use Analysis functions to use scores for FC fingerprinting. Analysis functions will return fingerprinting accuracy as well as the silhouette value and overlap ratio.
